# Simon Game

## Overview

The Simon Game is a classic memory-based electronic game that tests your memory and pattern recognition skills. In this project, you'll create a digital version of the Simon Game where players must remember and repeat a sequence of randomly generated colors and tones. The game will progressively become more challenging as the sequence gets longer.
## Features

- Randomly generated color and sound sequences for each level.
- Increasing difficulty with longer sequences.
- Interactive gameplay with a user-friendly interface.
- Sound and visual feedback for correct and incorrect moves.
- High score tracking to encourage competition and improvement.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the Simon Game project up and running on your local machine:

1. **Clone the repository** to your local system:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/simon-game.git
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:

3. **Open the `index.html` file** in your web browser to start playing the game.

## How to Play

1. When you start the game, a random color and sound sequence will be generated for you.

2. Pay close attention to the sequence as it plays. Each color will light up, and each corresponding sound will play.

3. After the sequence finishes, it's your turn to repeat it. Click on the colors in the same order they appeared, using your mouse or touch input.

4. If you get the sequence correct, you'll move on to the next level with an additional step in the sequence. If you make a mistake, the game will provide feedback and display your final score.

5. Try to beat your high score by reaching higher levels with longer sequences.
